Fliver is an app to help you get a Rickshaw easily. Whenever you need one, you can simply open the app and mark your location. When there are 3 or more Riders in the same area, Drivers get notified and can see the areas of high demand, and then come to pick you up.

The entire project is Open Source and free of charge. There are no additional costs for Riders besides for the regular metered Rickshaw fare, and there is no commission that Drivers need to pay. Fliver is a completely free and non-profit project, created to benefit Indian citizens. Check out our [FAQ](https://fliverdev.github.io/faq/) to learn more.

This is the Rider app repository for Riders to mark their locations and notify a Driver. It is part of the Final Year Project of three Computer Engineering students.
